# SOLID Principles

## S - Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should only have one job or responsibility. This makes code easier to maintain, test, and understand.

**Example:**
A class that handles user authentication should not also be responsible for logging user activity. These responsibilities should be separated into different classes.
